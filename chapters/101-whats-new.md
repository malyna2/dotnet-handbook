# What's New

This page is the handbook's changelog. When a new release lands, a popup announces it on your next visit. Under each release, **Site & functionality** items are plain notes, while **Content updates** link to every chapter that changed — a link is ticked off (✓, stored locally in your browser) once you visit it, so you can work through an update at your own pace and see what's still unread.

## Release — July 27, 2026

**🔧 Site & functionality**

- New **What's New** page (you're reading it): a release popup on your first visit after each update, this page at the end of the navigation menu, and locally-stored ✓ marks on the chapter links below once you've opened them.

**📖 Content updates**
